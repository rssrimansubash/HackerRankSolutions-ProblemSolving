# HackerRank-Solutions-ProblemSolving
Here are all the Solutions for the Problem Solving Challenges and Certificates.
This is throw-away code that is only supposed to correctly get the job done. I used the code stubs provided by HackerRank, so don't mind the unnecessary imports, naming convention and so on. Feel free to use my solutions as inspiration, but please don't literally copy the code.

# Certificates
To get a certificate, two problems have to be solved within 90 minutes.
The following is an incomplete list of possible problems per certificate as of 2021.09.15. Please let me know if the certificate problems have changed, so I can put a note here.
